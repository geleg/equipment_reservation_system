# Equipment Reservation and Management System

## Overview

Welcome to the Equipment Reservation and Management System! This is a robust solution designed to simplify equipment management, allowing administrators to seamlessly add equipment, while users can easily reserve and rent it. The system enforces intelligent restrictions, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.

### Key Features

- **User Roles:** Two distinct roles - administrators with equipment management privileges, and regular users with reservation capabilities.
- **Technologies Used:** React, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB, all intricately connected to provide a seamless experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The system is designed to be responsive across different screen resolutions.
- **Authentication:** Access is restricted to authenticated users, ensuring data security.

## Requirements

### Common User Actions

All users, regardless of their role, can:

- View the list of available equipment.
- Access detailed information about specific equipment.

### Administrator Actions

Administrators have additional privileges:

- Create and update equipment entries.
- Change equipment status (e.g., from draft to not draft).
- Monitor all reservations.
- Approve, disapprove, or mark reservations as rented.

### Regular User Actions

Regular users can:

- View their reservation history.
- Create new reservations.
- Modify reservation details (e.g., change dates).
- Cancel reservations.
